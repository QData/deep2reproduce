# deep2reproduce

- This is a growing list of course project reports from students in my machine learning and deep learning class at University of Virginia. 

- Each students team included up to four students to understand, reproduce and present one cutting-edge machine learning paper. 

- I also summarize more details of these paper surveys' at my site : [deep2read](https://qdata.github.io/deep2Read/)
